Set p9.24 and p9.26 as default can:
(source: https://www.thomas-wedemeyer.de/beaglebone-canbus-python.html)
"The configuration script is generated with : sudo nano /usr/bin/config_pins.sh
In this script all necessary IO-pins can be added. For the canbus only the two pin of p9.24 & p9.26 are nedded so enter:

#!/bin/bash
config-pin p9.24 can
config-pin p9.26 can

Make the script executeable with: sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/config_pins.sh

Setup of the service configuration: sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/config_pins.service and enter:

[Unit]
Description=Enable pin configuration at startup
After=generic-board-startup.service

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/config_pins.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

To activate the new service:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable config_pins.service

sudo reboot"

set can1 as active per default:
(source: https://www.thomas-wedemeyer.de/beaglebone-canbus-python.html)
"To start the CAN interface at system startup the /etc/network/interfaces configuration file can be used by adding the following lines:
allow-hotplug can1
 iface can1 can static

Install realtime patch:
(https://elinux.org/EBC_Exercise_36_PREEMPT_RT)

This is a set of instructions for installing the RT kernel. They are an alternate way from what was shown above. They are here for completeness. No need to install again.

To install a real time kernel, first see what you are currently running.

> uname -a
    Linux beaglebone 4.14.52-ti-r60 #1 SMP PREEMPT Tue Jun 26 23:02:46 UTC 2018 armv7l GNU/Linux
Also do the following.

> head /boot/uEnv.txt
    #Docs: http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:U-boot_partitioning_layout_2.0
    
    uname_r=4.14.52-ti-r60
    #uuid=
    #dtb=

Note what uname it is set to. You'll want to return to it when you are done.

Now, look for a kernel with similar number.

> sudo apt update
> apt-cache search linux-image-4.14 > /tmp/search

Look through /tmp/search and pick an image with -rt- in it's name.

> grep 14.52 /tmp/search

> sudo apt install linux-image-4.14.52-ti-rt-r60


Mine took some 2.5 minutes.
